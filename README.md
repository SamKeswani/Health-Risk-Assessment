# Health-Risk-Assessment
Predictive model that can accurately classify individuals into diseased or non-diseased categories based on their health attributes.

## Background

Healthcare professionals often rely on various diagnostic tests and biomarkers to assess an individual's health status and diagnose diseases. This project utilizes a dataset containing multiple health-related attributes, such as cholesterol levels, blood cell counts, hormone levels, and other physiological measurements, to predict the presence of a specific disease.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of an individual having a specific disease based on their health attributes. The model's performance will be evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Data Description

The dataset consists of the following attributes:

- **Cholesterol**: Level of cholesterol in the blood (mg/dL)
- **Hemoglobin**: Protein in red blood cells carrying oxygen
- **Platelets**: Blood cells aiding in clotting
- **White Blood Cells (WBC)**: Immune system cells fighting infections
- **Red Blood Cells (RBC)**: Cells carrying oxygen
- **Hematocrit**: Percentage of blood volume occupied by RBC
- **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)**: Average volume of RBC
- **Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH)**: Average amount of hemoglobin in RBC
- **Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC)**: Average concentration of hemoglobin in RBC
- **Insulin**: Hormone regulating blood sugar levels
- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: Measure of body fat based on height and weight
- **Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)**: Pressure in arteries during heartbeats
- **Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)**: Pressure in arteries at rest between beats
- **Triglycerides**: Type of fat found in blood (mg/dL)
- **HbA1c (Glycated Hemoglobin)**: Measure of average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months
- **LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) Cholesterol**: "Bad" cholesterol
- **HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) Cholesterol**: "Good" cholesterol
- **ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)**: Liver enzyme
- **AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)**: Enzyme found in liver and heart
- **Heart Rate**: Number of heartbeats per minute (bpm)
- **Creatinine**: Waste product produced by muscles and filtered by kidneys
- **Troponin**: Protein released into the bloodstream during heart muscle damage
- **C-reactive Protein (CRP)**: Marker of inflammation in the body
- **Disease**: Binary indicator (1: Diseased, 0: Non-diseased)
